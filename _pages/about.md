Haopeng Geng is currently pursuing a Ph.D. at The University of Tokyo. His research interests lie in solving atypical speech phenomena, such as L2 speech, accented speech, and pathological speech, using deep learning and signal processing methods.

Before joining UTokyo, he worked as an AI software engineer at Laronix, an Australian start-up company that developed the world‚Äôs first pneumatic larynx. In this role, he was responsible for evaluating and improving the speech quality of products designed for the voice loss community. He earned his M.S. and B.S. degrees from Nagoya University and Dalian University of Technology (DLUT), respectively.
